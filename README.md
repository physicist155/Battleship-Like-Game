# A Battleship Like Game


## Overview 
Welcome to our single-player, Python-based game, inspired by the classic board game Battleship! This project was developed as part of an introductory Python/programming course I attended at university in the second semester of 2022.

## Instructions:
* The goal here is to advance all way down the map with your boat.
* First things first: you start by placing your boat in a column in the beggining of the map.
* Then you can start moving your boat to either down, left or right. You have one move per round.
* But be careful! Each round 3 randoms strikes will be placed in the map. If the strike hits you, you're finished :(
* Also, if there is a ship where you tried to proceed, you'll lose your move. But if a strike hits a ship, it will sink and that place will now be free to pass over.
* You win by reaching the other side of the map without being hit by the strikes. Good luck and have fun!

## Notes:
* The code and comments are written (still) in Portuguese.
* The map of the game is contained in the "mapa.txt" file, the first line is the number of lines and columns of the map, respectively.
* You may change the position and number of ships but you need to respect the geometry presentend in the "mapa.txt" file.
