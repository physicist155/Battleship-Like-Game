# A Battleship Like Game

## This is a single player python based game inspired in the famous board game Battleship! This is code was developed during an python/programming introductory course that I took in university during the second semester of 2022.

### Instructions:
* The goal here is to advance all way down the map with your boat.
* First things first: you start by placing your boat in a column in the beggining of the map.
* Then you can start moving your boat to either down, left or right. You have one move per round.
* But be careful! Each round 3 randoms strikes will be placed in the map. If the strike hits you, you're finished :(
* Also, if there is a boat where you tried to proceed, you'll lose your move. But if a strike hits a boat, the boat will sink and that place will now be free to pass over.
* You win by reaching the other side of the map without being hit by the strikes! Good luck!
