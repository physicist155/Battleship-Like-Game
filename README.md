# A Battleship Like Game


## Overview 
Welcome to our single-player, Python-based game, inspired by the classic board game Battleship! This project was developed as part of an introductory Python/programming course I attended at university in the second semester of 2022.

## Instructions:
   1. Set Sail: Begin by placing your boat in a chosen column at the map's starting point.
   2. Navigate: Each round, move your boat down, left, or right. Remember, you get only one move per turn.
   3. Avoid Strikes: Watch out for 3 random strikes placed on the map every round. If a strike hits your boat, the game is over.
   4. Obstacle Ships: Be cautious of other ships on the map. Colliding with them costs you a move. However, if a strike sinks a ship, that path clears for safe passage.
   5. Victory: Reach the far side of the map unscathed by strikes to win. Plan carefully and enjoy the adventure!

## Game Notes:

   * Language: Currently, both the code and comments are in Portuguese.
   * Game Map: The game map is stored in "mapa.txt". The first line specifies the map's dimensions (rows and columns).
   * Customization: Feel free to alter the positions and number of ships, but ensure to maintain the map's original layout as outlined in "mapa.txt".
