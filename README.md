# A Battleship Like Game


## Overview 
Welcome to our single-player, Python-based game, inspired by the classic board game Battleship! This project was developed as part of an introductory Python/programming course I attended at university in the second semester of 2022.

## Instructions:
   1. Set Sail: Begin by placing your boat in a chosen column at the map's starting point.
   2. Navigate: Each round, move your boat down, left, or right. Remember, you get only one move per turn.
   3. Avoid Strikes: Watch out for 3 random strikes placed on the map every round. If a strike hits your boat, the game is over.
   4. Obstacle Ships: Be cautious of other ships on the map. Colliding with them costs you a move. However, if a strike sinks a ship, that path clears for safe passage.
   5. Victory: Reach the far side of the map unscathed by strikes to win. Plan carefully and enjoy the adventure!

## Notes:
* The code and comments are written (still) in Portuguese.
* The map of the game is contained in the "mapa.txt" file, the first line is the number of lines and columns of the map, respectively.
* You may change the position and number of ships but you need to respect the geometry presentend in the "mapa.txt" file.
