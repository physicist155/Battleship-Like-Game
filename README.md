# Battleship-Inspired  Game


## Overview 
Welcome to our single-player, **Python-based game**, inspired by the classic board game Battleship! This project was developed as part of an introductory Python/programming course I attended at university in the second semester of 2022.

### Instructions:
* The goal here is to advance all way down the map with your boat.
* First things first: you start by placing your boat in a column in the beggining of the map.
* Then you can start moving your boat to either down, left or right. You have one move per round.
* But be careful! Each round 3 randoms strikes will be placed in the map. If a strike hits you, you're finished :(
* Be cautious of other ships on the map. Colliding with them costs you a move. But if a strike hits a ship, it will sink and that path clears for safe passage.
* You win by reaching the other side of the map without being hit by the strikes. Good luck and have fun!

### Notes:
* The code and comments are written (still) in Portuguese.
* The map of the game is contained in the "mapa.txt" file. The first line specifies the map's dimensions (rows and columns).
*  Feel free to change the positions and number of ships, but ensure to maintain the map's original layout as outlined in "mapa.txt".
