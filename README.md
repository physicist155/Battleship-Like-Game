# Battleship-Like-Game

## This is a single player python based game inspired in the famous board game Battleship!

### Instructions:
* First things first: you start by placing your boat in a column in the beggining of the map.
* Then you can start moving your boat to either down, left or right. You have one move per round.
* But be careful! Each round 3 randoms strikes will be placed in the map. If the strike hits you, you're finished :(
